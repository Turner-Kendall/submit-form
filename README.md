# submit-form

#### One always needs a form, no?

###### This one uses Vue and Pico and is the form I test stuff with.

It's pretty nice and I thought that I would make it public in case anyone else needed a RAD form to send at an API, a contact form to mail front-end, or really whatever you might need an html form for.

You can clone this repository and then run:

`npm instal`
`npm run dev`

and that will get you a form and a few helper / starter functions to hopefully speed up your development process.  Or at least not to have to mess with the form basics, etc.

`npm run build` 

Will build your form into a little web app, if you need that kinda thing.
